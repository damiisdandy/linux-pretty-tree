# Unix Tree ðŸŒ³

A simply package inspired by the unix [tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tree-command-unixlinux/) package, my package doesn't have all the features and all, but I built it out of curiosity.

I simply walks through files and folders within a directory and render then in a nice way :)

## How to use
It takes the folder path as the arguement, if left blank it looks at the current directory

### Options
```bash
--show-hidden-files   # show all files including hidden files e.g (.git)
--install-completion  # Install completions for the current shell
--show-completion     # Show completion for the current shell
--help                # help menu
```
